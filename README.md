**Need to do:**

1. API access - Trailforks - emailed them?

2. Maybe look at Hiker API?

3. PROB end up using Natl Park Service API - [https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/get-started.htm](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/get-started.htm)

4. Mongo Atlas setup



NOTES:

- Tested POST and GET ```/user``` routes on Swagger - created user with a POST and read with a GET request.

- Need to get NPS API routes going
