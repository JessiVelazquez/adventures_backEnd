**Description:** This is a National Parks trip planner that uses NPS API for it's data source. A personal project currently in development.

**Need to do:**

1. Using Natl Park Service API - [https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/get-started.htm](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/get-started.htm) - Other API's looked at were Trailforks (emailed them for key), and HikerAPI.

4. Mongo Atlas setup
